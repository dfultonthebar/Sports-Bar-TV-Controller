# Scheduler Build Fix

## Issue
After pulling the latest scheduler updates from GitHub, the build was failing with TypeScript errors:

```
Type error: Property 'executionOrder' does not exist on type 'Schedule'.
Type error: Property 'delayBetweenCommands' does not exist on type 'Schedule'.
```

## Root Cause
The scheduler page (`src/app/scheduler/page.tsx`) defined its own local `Schedule` interface that was missing two fields that exist in the Prisma schema:
- `executionOrder` - Controls whether to power on TVs first or set channels first
- `delayBetweenCommands` - Milliseconds to wait between commands

## Solution
Added the missing fields to the local `Schedule` interface definition:

```typescript
interface Schedule {
  // ... existing fields ...
  executionOrder: string;
  delayBetweenCommands: number;
  // ... rest of fields ...
}
```

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `/src/app/scheduler/page.tsx`**:
   - Added `executionOrder: string` field to Schedule interface
   - Added `delayBetweenCommands: number` field to Schedule interface

2. **Verified Prisma Schema**:
   - Confirmed both fields exist in `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Regenerated Prisma client to ensure type sync

3. **Build Verification**:
   - Successfully built the application
   - All TypeScript checks passed
   - No remaining errors

## Build Results
✅ **Build Status**: SUCCESS

Route count:
- 149 total routes
- 4 new scheduler routes:
  - `/api/scheduler/status`
  - `/api/schedules`
  - `/api/schedules/[id]`
  - `/api/schedules/execute`
  - `/api/schedules/logs`
- New `/scheduler` page (5.1 kB)

## Next Steps
To run the updated application:

```bash
# Method 1: Using update script (recommended)
cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
./update_from_github.sh

# Method 2: Manual startup
cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
npm run dev

# Method 3: Production build
cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
npm run build
npm start
```

## Scheduler Features Now Available
With this fix, the scheduler system is fully operational:

1. **Smart Scheduling**:
   - Daily, weekly, or one-time schedules
   - Automatic game detection based on home teams
   - Multi-provider support (cable, satellite, streaming)

2. **TV Control**:
   - Power on/off selected TVs
   - Set default channels per input
   - Control execution order and timing

3. **Game Detection**:
   - Monitor home team schedules
   - Auto-find games from multiple sources
   - Priority-based provider selection

4. **Logging**:
   - Track all schedule executions
   - Record success/failure status
   - Detailed execution reports

## Files Changed
- ✅ `src/app/scheduler/page.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript interface
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
