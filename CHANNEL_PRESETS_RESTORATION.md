# Channel Presets Restoration Summary

## Issue
DirecTV and cable box channel presets were missing from the Sports Bar TV Controller application.

## Root Cause
The `ChannelPreset` table exists in the database schema but was empty. The seed script that was previously created to populate channel presets was removed from the repository, leaving the table without any data.

## Solution
Restored the channel preset seed data by:
1. Recreating the seed SQL script with 29 default channel presets
2. Creating a convenience shell script to run the seed
3. Testing the seed locally to verify functionality

## Files Created/Restored

### 1. `scripts/seeds/channel-presets.sql`
SQL seed file containing:
- **14 Cable Box presets**: ESPN, ESPN2, Fox Sports 1, NFL Network, NBA TV, MLB Network, NHL Network, Fox Sports 2, TNT, TBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX
- **15 DirecTV presets**: ESPN, ESPN2, Fox Sports 1, NFL Network, NFL RedZone, NBA TV, MLB Network, NHL Network, Fox Sports 2, TNT, TBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX

### 2. `scripts/seed-channel-presets.sh`
Convenience shell script that:
- Validates the database exists
- Runs the seed SQL file
- Verifies the seeded data
- Provides clear feedback on success/failure

## Usage

### Running the Seed Script Locally
```bash
cd /path/to/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
./scripts/seed-channel-presets.sh
```

### Running on Remote Server
```bash
# SSH into the server
sshpass -p '6809233DjD$$$' ssh -p 224 \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \
  -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
  ubuntu@24.123.87.42

# Navigate to project directory
cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller

# Run the seed script
./scripts/seed-channel-presets.sh
```

## Verification

After running the seed script, verify the presets are available:

### Check Database Directly
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/data/sports_bar.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ChannelPreset;"
# Should return: 29
```

### Check via API
```bash
# Get cable presets
curl http://localhost:3000/api/channel-presets?deviceType=cable

# Get DirecTV presets
curl http://localhost:3000/api/channel-presets?deviceType=directv
```

### Check in UI
1. Navigate to the Bartender Remote page
2. Select a Cable Box or DirecTV input
3. Channel preset buttons should appear below the channel controls
4. Click a preset to verify it changes the channel

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
The `ChannelPreset` table includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: User-friendly channel name
- `channelNumber`: Channel number to tune to
- `deviceType`: "cable" or "directv"
- `order`: Display order in the list
- `isActive`: Boolean flag for active presets
- `usageCount`: Tracks how many times preset has been used
- `lastUsed`: Timestamp of last usage
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt`: Last update timestamp

### AI-Powered Auto-Reordering
The system includes an AI-powered auto-reordering feature that:
- Tracks usage of each preset via `usageCount` and `lastUsed` fields
- Automatically reorders presets monthly based on usage patterns
- Runs via cron job at 3:00 AM on the 1st of each month
- Can be manually triggered via API: `POST /api/channel-presets/reorder`

- `docs/CHANNEL_PRESETS_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Enhancement features

## Deployment Notes
- ✅ Tested locally on development database
- The seed script is idempotent (clears existing presets before inserting)
- Can be run multiple times without issues
- Does not affect other database tables or configurations

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to remote server following ssh.md guidelines
2. Verify presets appear in the live application
3. Test channel changing functionality with both cable and DirecTV inputs
4. Monitor usage patterns to ensure AI reordering works correctly

## Support
If presets are still missing after running the seed script:
1. Verify database path is correct: `prisma/data/sports_bar.db`
2. Check database permissions
3. Verify the API endpoints are working: `/api/channel-presets`
4. Check server logs for any errors
5. Restart the application: `pm2 restart all`
