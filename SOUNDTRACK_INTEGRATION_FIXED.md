# ✅ Soundtrack Your Brand Integration - FIXED

## The Problem
Your Soundtrack Your Brand integration was getting **404 Not Found** errors because:
1. ❌ Wrong authentication method (Bearer token instead of Basic)
2. ❌ Trying to use REST endpoints that don't exist
3. ❌ No GraphQL implementation

## The Solution
✅ **Fixed Authentication**: Changed to Basic Authentication (correct method)
✅ **Implemented GraphQL**: Using official Soundtrack API patterns
✅ **Added Delete Feature**: Can now remove API token configuration
✅ **Better UX**: Clear terminology, helpful links, better error messages

## What You Can Do Now

### 1. Configure Soundtrack
```
/soundtrack → Enter API Token → Save
```

### 2. Delete Configuration (NEW!)
```
/soundtrack → Click Delete → Confirm → Done
```

### 3. Manage Sound Zones
```
/soundtrack → Toggle Visibility → Set Order
```

### 4. Test Connection
```
/soundtrack → Test API Connection → View Results
```

## How to Get API Token

1. Visit: https://api.soundtrackyourbrand.com/v2/docs
2. Click "Request API Access"
3. Fill form (use account: "Graystone Ale House")
4. Wait for approval email
5. Copy your Base64-encoded token
6. Paste into `/soundtrack` page

## Files Changed

| File | What Changed |
|------|--------------|
| `src/lib/soundtrack-your-brand.ts` | Complete rewrite using GraphQL |
| `src/app/api/soundtrack/config/route.ts` | Added DELETE endpoint |
| `src/components/SoundtrackConfiguration.tsx` | Delete button + UI improvements |

## Authentication Fix

### Before (Wrong) ❌
```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
}
```

### After (Correct) ✅
```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Basic ${token}`
}
```

## Test It

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
git pull

# 2. Visit configuration page
# Open browser to: http://localhost:3000/soundtrack

# 3. Enter your API token and test
```
