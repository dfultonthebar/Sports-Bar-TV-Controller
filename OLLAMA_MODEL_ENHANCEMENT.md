# Ollama Model Download Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the installation script to automatically download and verify all required AI models during the Ollama installation phase. This ensures the application is fully functional immediately after installation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `install_ollama()` Function
- **Improved Service Readiness Check**: Replaced simple `sleep 5` with active polling of Ollama API endpoint
- **Timeout Handling**: Added 30-second timeout with proper error handling
- **Model Download Integration**: Calls new `download_ollama_models()` function

### 2. New `download_ollama_models()` Function
A comprehensive model download function with the following features:

#### Required Models
The function downloads all four models required by the application:

1. **llama3.2:3b** - Primary model
   - Used by: Enhanced Chat API, Tool Chat API, Log Analysis API
   - Purpose: Main AI capabilities for chat and analysis

2. **phi3:mini** - Lightweight model
   - Used by: General Chat API
   - Purpose: Fast responses for general chat interface

3. **llama2** - Backup model
   - Used by: Device diagnostics (as per install-local-ai.sh)
   - Purpose: Fallback for device-related queries

4. **mistral** - Fast model
   - Used by: Quick queries (as per install-local-ai.sh)
   - Purpose: Rapid responses for simple queries

#### Key Features

**Progress Indicators**
- Shows current model number (e.g., "Model 2 of 4")
- Displays model name and purpose
- Visual separators for clarity
- Real-time download status

**Retry Logic**
- 3 attempts per model
- 5-second delay between retries
- Clear retry attempt messages
- Graceful handling of network failures

**Verification**
- Checks if model already exists before downloading
- Verifies successful download with `ollama list`
- Double-checks model availability after pull
- Tracks failed models for reporting

**Error Handling**
- Non-blocking failures (installation continues even if models fail)
- Detailed troubleshooting guidance
- Lists all failed models at the end
- Provides manual recovery steps

**User Experience**
- Clear, colorful output with visual separators
- Estimated time information (10-30 minutes)
- Summary of installed models
- Feature-to-model mapping in success message

## Technical Details

### Sequential Downloads
Models are downloaded one at a time to:
- Avoid resource contention
- Ensure reliable downloads
- Provide clear progress tracking
- Simplify error handling

### Verification Process
Each model goes through:
1. Pre-check: Skip if already installed
2. Download: Pull with retry logic
3. Verification: Confirm with `ollama list`
4. Reporting: Add to success or failure list

### Error Recovery
If models fail to download:
- Installation continues (non-blocking)
- User receives clear warning
- Troubleshooting steps provided
- Models can be downloaded manually later

## Benefits

1. **Complete Installation**: All AI features work immediately after installation
2. **Reliability**: Retry logic handles temporary network issues
3. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what's being downloaded and why
4. **Robustness**: Graceful handling of failures with recovery guidance
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear progress indicators and helpful messages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Fresh Install**: Test on system without Ollama
2. **Existing Install**: Test with Ollama already installed
3. **Partial Models**: Test with some models already present
4. **Network Issues**: Test retry logic with simulated failures
5. **Disk Space**: Test behavior with insufficient space

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Parallel downloads with proper resource management
- Model size information before download
- Download progress bars (if Ollama API supports it)
- Configurable model list via environment variables
- Optional model downloads (core vs. optional)

## Commit Message

```
feat: enhance Ollama installation with complete model downloads

- Add download_ollama_models() function for comprehensive model management
- Download all 4 required models: llama3.2:3b, phi3:mini, llama2, mistral
- Implement retry logic (3 attempts) for network resilience
- Add verification checks for each downloaded model
- Improve service readiness check with active polling
- Provide clear progress indicators and troubleshooting guidance
- Ensure non-blocking failures with helpful error messages

This ensures all AI features are immediately functional after installation,
eliminating the need for manual model downloads.
