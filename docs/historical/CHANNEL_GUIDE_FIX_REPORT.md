# Channel Guide Fix - Deployment Report
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

---

## 🎯 Primary Issue Fixed

### Problem
Channel guide was **not loading** when users selected any input (Cable Box, DirecTV, Fire TV). The channel guide interface would appear but showed no sports programming data.

### Root Cause Identified
The Sports Guide API returns dates without years (e.g., `"Oct 27"`, `"Oct 28"`). The code was parsing these dates incorrectly:

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
new Date("Oct 27 7:00 pm")  // JavaScript defaulted to year 2001!
// Result: Sat Oct 27 2001 19:00:00 GMT

// AFTER (FIXED):
new Date("Oct 27 2025 7:00 pm")  // Correctly adds current year
// Result: Tue Oct 28 2025 19:00:00 GMT
```

**Impact:** All events were parsed as 2001 dates. The frontend filtering logic removed all "past" events, resulting in an empty channel guide.

## 🔧 Technical Fix

### File Modified
`src/app/api/channel-guide/route.ts`

### Changes Made
1. **Added proper date parsing logic** that includes the current year
2. **Smart year detection**: Falls back to next year if parsed date is in the past
3. **Improved date handling** for edge cases

### Code Changes (Lines 154-191)
```typescript
// Parse the date properly - API returns dates like "Oct 27" without year
// We need to add the current year to make it valid
let eventDate: Date
if (listing.date) {
  // Parse the date and add current year if missing
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear()
  const dateWithYear = `${listing.date} ${currentYear} ${listing.time}`
  eventDate = new Date(dateWithYear)
  
  // If the parsed date is invalid or in the past (more than 1 day ago), try next year
  if (isNaN(eventDate.getTime()) || eventDate.getTime() < Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
    eventDate = new Date(`${listing.date} ${currentYear + 1} ${listing.time}`)
  }
} else {
  // Fallback to today if no date provided
  eventDate = new Date(`${new Date().toDateString()} ${listing.time}`)
}

// Calculate end time (3 hours after start for sports events)
const endTime = new Date(eventDate.getTime() + 3 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
```
