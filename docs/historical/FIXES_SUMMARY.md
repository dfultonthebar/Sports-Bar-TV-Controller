# Fixes Applied - Atlas Zone Labels, Matrix Label Updates, and Matrix Test

## Issue 1: Atlas Zone Output Labels Wrong
**Problem**: Zone labels showing "Matrix 1", "Matrix 2", "Matrix 3", "Matrix 4" instead of actual Atlas configuration labels.

**Root Cause**: AudioZoneControl.tsx was using hardcoded labels instead of reading from Atlas configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Modified AudioZoneControl.tsx to read zone labels from Atlas outputs API
- Labels now dynamically pulled from Atlas processor configuration
- Falls back to "Matrix 1-4" only if Atlas config unavailable

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/AudioZoneControl.tsx

## Issue 2: Matrix Label Not Updating When Input Selected
**Problem**: When selecting a video input for Matrix 1-4 audio outputs, the matrix label doesn't update dynamically to show the video input name.

**Root Cause**: 
1. The video-input-selection API was updating the database correctly
2. However, AudioZoneControl.tsx wasn't refreshing after the update
3. The component needed to re-fetch configuration after video input changes

**Solution**:
- Added state refresh mechanism in AudioZoneControl.tsx
- Component now re-fetches Atlas configuration after video input selection
- Labels update immediately to reflect the selected video input name
- Example: "Matrix 1" → "Cable Box 1" when Cable Box 1 is selected

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/AudioZoneControl.tsx
- Added refresh trigger after video input selection

## Issue 3: Matrix Test Database Error
**Problem**: Wolf Pack Connection Test failing with "PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid prisma.testLog.create() invocation"

**Root Cause**: 
- The testLog.create() calls in test routes were passing `duration` as a number
- However, the Prisma schema defined `duration` as `Int?` (nullable integer)
- When duration was 0 or very small, it was being treated as falsy and causing issues
- The error occurred because the data object structure didn't match the schema expectations

**Solution**:
- Updated test-connection route to ensure proper data types
- Added explicit null checks for optional fields
- Ensured duration is always a valid integer or explicitly null
- Fixed data object structure to match Prisma schema exactly

**Files Modified**:
- src/app/api/tests/wolfpack/connection/route.ts
- src/app/api/tests/wolfpack/switching/route.ts

## Testing Performed
1. ✅ Atlas zone labels now display correctly from configuration
2. ✅ Matrix labels update dynamically when video input selected
3. ✅ Wolf Pack Connection Test passes without database errors
4. ✅ All changes tested locally before deployment

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required (schema already correct)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with existing configurations
