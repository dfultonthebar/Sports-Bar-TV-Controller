# Soundtrack Your Brand API - Enhanced Error Handling & Diagnostics

## Summary

I've investigated the Soundtrack Your Brand API errors you're experiencing and implemented comprehensive diagnostic and troubleshooting tools to help identify and resolve the issue.

## The Problem

All Soundtrack Your Brand API endpoints are returning **404 Not Found** errors:
- `/api/soundtrack/account` - 404
- `/api/soundtrack/players` - 404
- `/api/soundtrack/stations` - 404

This suggests one of the following:
1. **API endpoints have changed** (v2 → v3 or different structure)
2. **API key has expired or been revoked**
3. **Account/subscription issues**
4. **Authentication method has changed**

## What I've Implemented

### 1. Enhanced API Client (`src/lib/soundtrack-your-brand.ts`)
✅ **Automatic Authentication Fallback**
   - Now tries both Bearer token and Basic authentication
   - Automatically retries with alternative method on 401/403 errors

✅ **Better Error Messages**
   - Specific messages for 404, 401, 403 errors
   - Guidance on what each error means

✅ **Connection Diagnostic Method**
   - Tests multiple API versions (v1, v2, v3)
   - Tests multiple endpoints (/account, /accounts, /me, /soundzones, /players)
   - Finds working combinations automatically

### 2. Diagnostic API Endpoint (`/api/soundtrack/diagnose`)
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Tests all possible API version and endpoint combinations
   - Provides detailed diagnostic results
   - Returns specific recommendations

### 3. Enhanced Configuration UI (`/soundtrack`)
✅ **"Test API Connection" Button**
   - One-click diagnostic test
   - Shows detailed results in the UI
   - Provides actionable recommendations

✅ **Better Error Display**
   - Clear troubleshooting steps
   - Links to Soundtrack support resources
   - Helpful guidance for resolution

### 4. Improved Bartender Remote (`/remote`)
✅ **Enhanced Error Messages**
   - Specific 404 error handling
   - Troubleshooting steps displayed to bartenders
   - Guidance to contact management

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation
✅ **Troubleshooting Guide** (`SOUNDTRACK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
   - Detailed problem analysis
   - Step-by-step resolution steps
   - Manual testing commands
   - Contact information for Soundtrack support

## How to Use the Diagnostic Tools

### Method 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Navigate to: **http://192.168.1.25:3000/soundtrack**
2. Click the **"Test API Connection"** button
3. Review the diagnostic results
4. Follow the recommendations provided

### Method 2: Check Bartender Remote
1. Navigate to: **http://192.168.1.25:3000/remote**
2. Click the **"Music"** tab
3. Review any error messages and troubleshooting steps

## Next Steps to Resolve the Issue

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Run the Diagnostic Tool**
   - Go to `/soundtrack`
   - Click "Test API Connection"
   - See what the diagnostic finds

2. **Check Soundtrack Account**
   - Log in to: https://business.soundtrackyourbrand.com/
   - Verify subscription is active
   - Check for any notifications or alerts

3. **Check API Settings**
   - Look for API configuration in your Soundtrack dashboard
   - Check if there's a new API version or endpoint information
   - Consider regenerating the API key

4. **Contact Soundtrack Support**
   - Email: support@soundtrackyourbrand.com
   - Provide: 
     - Account: Graystone Ale House
     - Error: "All API v2 endpoints returning 404"
     - Request: Current API endpoint information

### If API Has Changed:

If Soundtrack support confirms the API endpoints have changed, I can update the integration:
1. They'll provide the new base URL (e.g., `v3` instead of `v2`)
2. We'll update the code in `src/lib/soundtrack-your-brand.ts`
3. Rebuild and restart the application
4. Everything should work again

## Database Status

Current Soundtrack configuration in your database:
```
API Key: Configured (132 characters, Base64-encoded)
Account ID: null
Account Name: null
Status: active
Last Tested: 2025-10-01 15:39:53
```

**Note**: The account name showing "Graystone Ale House" in your browser might be cached data from when the API was working previously.

## Features Still Working

All other application features continue to work normally:
- ✅ Matrix control
- ✅ Device configuration  
- ✅ CEC control
- ✅ Sports guide
- ✅ Bartender remote (except music)
- ✅ AI assistant
- ✅ All other integrations

The Soundtrack integration is isolated, so this issue doesn't affect anything else.

## Testing the Fix

Once you get updated information from Soundtrack or regenerate the API key:

1. **Update API Key** (if needed)
   - Go to `/soundtrack`
   - Enter new API key
   - Click "Save API Key"

2. **Test Connection**
   - Click "Test API Connection"
   - Should show success if endpoint/key is correct

3. **Refresh Players**
   - Click "Refresh Players"
   - Players should appear if API is working

4. **Test Bartender Remote**
   - Go to `/remote` → Music tab
   - Should show players and controls
