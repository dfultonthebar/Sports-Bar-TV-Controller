## Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails
1. Check that `uploads/` directory exists
2. Verify file permissions
3. Check file size (keep under 50MB)
4. Verify file format (PDF, MD, TXT only)

### If Q&A Not Working
1. Check that `data/` directory exists
2. Verify write permissions on `data/qa-entries.json`
3. Manually rebuild: `npm run build-knowledge-base`
4. Check browser console for errors

### If AI Not Using Training Data
1. Verify knowledge base was rebuilt
2. Check `data/ai-knowledge-base.json` exists
3. Test with exact question from Q&A entry
4. Try rephrasing the question

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `docs/AI_TEACHING_INTERFACE.md` for detailed documentation
2. Review `docs/AI_BACKEND_SETUP.md` for backend information
