## Troubleshooting

**Q: AI says "no relevant documentation found"**
- Rebuild the knowledge base
- Try rephrasing your question
- Check if that topic is in your documentation

**Q: Responses are slow**
- This is normal for complex questions
- Ollama is processing ~3000 characters of context
- Wait 5-10 seconds for detailed responses

**Q: "Ollama connection error"**
- Check Ollama status: `systemctl status ollama`
- Restart if needed: `systemctl restart ollama`
- Verify it's running on port 11434

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Try the sample questions above
2. ‚úÖ Upload any additional equipment manuals
3. ‚úÖ Rebuild KB to include new docs
4. ‚úÖ Bookmark the AI Assistant page
5. ‚úÖ Use it for daily troubleshooting!
