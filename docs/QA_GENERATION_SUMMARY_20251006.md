## Sample Q&A Pairs

### Example 1: System Overview
**Q:** What is the Sports Bar TV Controller system and what does it do?

**A:** The Sports Bar TV Controller is a comprehensive AI-powered system for managing sports bar audio/video equipment. It controls Wolfpack HDMI matrix switchers, AtlasIED audio processors, DirecTV/Fire TV devices via IR control, and TVs via HDMI-CEC. The system includes an AI assistant trained on equipment manuals, automated scheduling, channel presets, and real-time device monitoring.

**Category:** system

### Example 2: Installation
**Q:** How do I install the Sports Bar TV Controller for the first time?

**A:** Installation is automated: 1) Clone the repository from GitHub, 2) Run './install.sh' which automatically installs Node.js, PostgreSQL, libCEC drivers, and all dependencies, 3) The script sets up the database and creates configuration files, 4) Start the application with 'npm run dev' or 'pm2 start ecosystem.config.js', 5) Access the web interface at http://localhost:3000. The installation script handles everything including HDMI-CEC support.

**Category:** setup

### Example 3: Configuration
**Q:** How do I configure the Wolfpack matrix switcher?

**A:** Configure the matrix through Settings → Matrix Configuration: 1) Enter the matrix IP address and ports (TCP: 5000, UDP: 4000, default: 4999), 2) Configure input channels (1-32) with labels like 'Cable Box 1', 'DirecTV', device types, and status, 3) Configure output channels with TV labels, resolution (1080p/4K), audio routing to Atlas zones, and CEC settings, 4) Optionally set CEC adapter input channel for TV power control, 5) Test the connection to verify communication. All settings are stored in the MatrixConfiguration database table.

**Category:** configuration

### Example 4: Features
**Q:** How does HDMI-CEC TV control work in the system?

**A:** HDMI-CEC control uses a Pulse-Eight USB CEC adapter connected to the server and routed through the Wolfpack matrix: 1) The adapter connects to a dedicated matrix input (e.g., Input 10), 2) LibCEC software (automatically installed) sends commands via USB, 3) Commands are routed through the matrix to specific TV outputs, 4) Supported commands include power on/off, input switching, volume control, and mute, 5) The system can scan for CEC devices and auto-detect TV brands/models, 6) CEC controls are available in the bartender remote and dedicated CEC control page.

**Category:** features

---

### Example 5: API
**Q:** What API endpoints are available for Q&A management?

**A:** Q&A API endpoints at /api/ai/qa-entries: GET (list all entries with optional filters for category/sourceType, or search with query parameter, or get statistics with stats=true), POST (create new entry with question, answer, category, tags), PUT (update entry by id with any fields), DELETE (remove entry by id). Additional endpoints: /api/ai/qa-generate (generate Q&As from docs), /api/ai/qa-upload (bulk upload Q&A documents). All endpoints return JSON responses.

**Category:** api

---

### Example 6: Troubleshooting
**Q:** How do I troubleshoot a TV with no signal?

**A:** Troubleshooting steps: 1) Check matrix routing - verify correct input is routed to the TV output, 2) Verify input device is powered on and outputting signal, 3) Check HDMI cable connections at matrix and TV, 4) Test with a known working input to isolate the issue, 5) Check TV input selection via CEC or manual remote, 6) Verify matrix configuration shows correct input/output labels, 7) Check matrix connection status in Settings, 8) Review system logs for routing errors. The AI assistant can guide through systematic troubleshooting based on symptoms.
