## Technical Implementation

/api/device-subscriptions/
├── GET     - Retrieve subscription data
├── poll/   
    └── POST - Poll device for current subscriptions
```

### Data Storage
- JSON file-based storage in `/data/device-subscriptions.json`
- Includes device metadata, subscription details, and polling history
