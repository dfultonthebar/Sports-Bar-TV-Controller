# Soundtrack Your Brand Integration - Update Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Authentication (Critical Issue)
**Problem:** The integration was using `Bearer` token authentication, but Soundtrack API requires `Basic` authentication.

**Solution:** Updated all API calls to use the correct authentication header:
```
Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASE64_TOKEN
```

This was the root cause of the 404 errors you were experiencing.

### 2. Implemented GraphQL API
Based on the official Soundtrack example app, the API uses GraphQL, not REST endpoints.

**New Implementation:**
- GraphQL queries for fetching data (accounts, sound zones, stations)
- GraphQL mutations for controlling playback (play, pause, volume, station changes)
- Proper query structure matching Soundtrack's schema

### 3. Added Delete Configuration Feature
You can now delete the Soundtrack API token configuration:
- Click "Delete" button in the configuration page
- Confirmation required (safety measure)
- Removes token and all associated sound zone data
- Can reconfigure with a new token anytime

### 4. Updated Terminology
Changed from confusing "players" terminology to Soundtrack's proper naming:
- **Sound Zones**: What Soundtrack calls their audio playback areas
- Updated all UI elements, database references, and documentation

### 5. Improved User Experience
- Better error messages with actionable suggestions
- Links to official Soundtrack API documentation
- Clear instructions on how to get API token
- Enter key support in token input field
- Cancel option for delete confirmation

## How to Use

### Initial Setup
1. Go to `/soundtrack` page in your app
2. Click the link to request API access: https://api.soundtrackyourbrand.com/v2/docs
3. Fill out the form with your business details (account: "Graystone Ale House")
4. Wait for approval and receive your Base64-encoded API token
5. Paste the token into the configuration page
6. Click "Save API Token"

### The system will:
- Validate your token by connecting to Soundtrack
- Fetch your account information
- Load all your sound zones
- Save the configuration

### Managing Sound Zones
1. After saving token, you'll see all your sound zones
2. Toggle visibility for each zone (which ones bartenders can control)
3. Set display order (1, 2, 3, etc.) to control the order in the remote
4. Click "Visible" to make a zone available in the bartender interface

### Deleting Configuration
1. Click "Delete" button next to your configured token
2. Button changes to "Click to Confirm" (red)
3. Click again to permanently delete
4. Or click "Cancel" to abort
