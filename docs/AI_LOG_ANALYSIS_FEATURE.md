## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Error Analysis
1. Open AI Assistant page
2. Click "Analyze Recent Errors" button
3. AI automatically:
   - Fetches recent error logs
   - Analyzes patterns
   - Provides diagnosis and recommendations

### Example 2: Detailed Log Investigation
1. Click "System Logs" button
2. Set filters:
   - Time Range: Last 6 Hours
   - Category: Hardware
   - Errors Only: âœ“
3. Click "Refresh" to load logs
4. Review individual log entries with details
5. Click "Analyze with AI" for AI-powered insights

### Example 3: Export for External Analysis
1. Open System Logs viewer
2. Configure desired filters
3. Click "Export" button
4. JSON file downloads with logs and analytics

### Example 4: Chat with Log Context
1. Ask the AI: "What hardware errors occurred today?"
2. AI uses log analysis to provide specific answers
3. Sources include actual log entries
4. Recommendations based on real system data

## Log Entry Structure

Each log entry contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `level`: Severity level (debug, info, warn, error, critical)
- `category`: Log category
- `source`: Origin of the log
- `action`: Action being performed
- `message`: Human-readable message
- `details`: Additional structured data
- `success`: Operation success status
- `duration`: Operation duration (ms)
- `deviceType`: Device type (if applicable)
- `deviceId`: Device identifier (if applicable)
- `errorStack`: Stack trace (for errors)

## AI Analysis Capabilities

The AI can:
1. **Identify Root Causes**: Analyze error patterns to find underlying issues
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine how errors affect system operations
3. **Provide Immediate Actions**: Suggest what to do right now
4. **Recommend Prevention**: How to avoid future issues
5. **Evaluate System Health**: Overall system status assessment

## Integration with Knowledge Base

When analyzing logs, the AI can:
- Cross-reference with system documentation
- Find relevant troubleshooting guides
- Provide context-aware solutions
- Link to specific documentation sections

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check logs daily for early issue detection
2. **Use Filters**: Focus on specific categories or time ranges
3. **Export Important Logs**: Keep records of critical incidents
4. **Act on Recommendations**: Follow AI suggestions promptly
5. **Enable Knowledge Base**: Get more accurate, documentation-backed analysis

## System Health Indicators

- **Healthy**: Error rate < 5%
- **Warning**: Error rate 5-10%
- **Critical**: Error rate > 10%

## Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Loading
- Check that the application is running
- Verify log files exist in `/logs` directory
- Check browser console for errors

### AI Analysis Fails
- Ensure Ollama is running (`http://localhost:11434`)
- Verify the model is available
- Check network connectivity

### Empty Log Results
- Adjust time range (try longer periods)
- Remove restrictive filters
- Check if system has been active

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Real-time log streaming
- Automated alert triggers
- Log pattern learning
- Predictive issue detection
- Integration with external monitoring tools

## Technical Details

### Log Storage
- Logs stored in `/logs` directory
- Separate files per category
- Automatic log rotation at 50MB
- Maintains up to 10 rotated files

### Performance
- Logs cached for 5 minutes
- Efficient filtering at API level
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Optimized JSON parsing

## Security Considerations

- Logs may contain sensitive information
- Export feature requires user action
- No automatic external transmission
- Local storage only

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check system logs for errors
2. Review AI Assistant documentation
3. Use the AI Assistant to diagnose issues
4. Contact system administrator if needed
