5. **optimize_db**: Vacuum and optimize database
6. **clear_cache**: Clear application caches

## API Endpoints

The diagnostics system exposes these endpoints:

- `GET /api/diagnostics/status` - Get current system status
- `POST /api/diagnostics/light-check` - Run light health check
- `POST /api/diagnostics/deep` - Run deep diagnostics
- `POST /api/diagnostics/self-heal` - Trigger self-healing
- `GET /api/diagnostics/metrics?hours=24` - Get metrics
- `GET /api/diagnostics/issue-stats` - Get issue statistics
- `GET /api/diagnostics/fix-stats` - Get fix statistics
- `POST /api/chat/diagnostics` - AI chatbot endpoint

## Database Schema

The system uses these Prisma models:

- **SystemHealthCheck**: Individual health check results
- **Issue**: Detected problems and their status
- **Fix**: Applied fixes and their outcomes
- **SystemMetric**: Historical metrics for trends
- **LearningPattern**: Identified patterns and predictions
- **DiagnosticRun**: Summary of diagnostic executions

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not loading
1. Check if the server is running: `pm2 status`
2. Check database connectivity
3. Review browser console for errors

### Chatbot not responding
1. Verify OpenAI API key is configured
2. Check `/api/chat/diagnostics` endpoint
3. Review server logs for errors

### Charts showing no data
1. Run a light check to generate data
2. Wait for scheduled checks to run
3. Check database for records

### Manual checks failing
1. Review error message in UI
2. Check server logs
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Ensure PM2 is running

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check dashboard daily
2. **Review Patterns**: Look at learning patterns weekly
3. **Manual Checks**: Run deep diagnostics before major events
4. **Issue Resolution**: Address high/critical issues promptly
5. **Uptime Goals**: Maintain >99% uptime
6. **Resource Management**: Keep CPU/memory/disk below 80%
