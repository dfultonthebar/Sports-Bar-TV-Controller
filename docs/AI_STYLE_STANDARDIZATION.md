# AI-Powered Color Scheme Standardization

This document describes the AI-powered tools created to standardize the color scheme across all components in the Sports Bar AI Assistant application.

## Overview

The system uses local AI (Ollama) to automatically analyze React components, identify styling inconsistencies, and suggest or apply fixes to match the standardized color scheme.

## Components

### 1. Color Scheme Standard (`COLOR_SCHEME_STANDARD.md`)

A comprehensive style guide that documents:
- **Color palette**: Background, text, accent, and border colors
- **Component patterns**: Standardized styling for cards, buttons, badges, inputs, tabs, etc.
- **Rules to follow**: Guidelines for text contrast, component styling, and interactive elements
- **Anti-patterns**: What NOT to use
- **Accessibility standards**: Contrast ratios and focus indicators
- **Implementation checklist**: Step-by-step guide for updating components

This serves as the single source of truth for all styling decisions.

### 2. AI Style Analyzer (`scripts/ai-style-analyzer.js`)

An intelligent analyzer that:
- **Scans all React components** in the `src/` directory
- **Uses Ollama AI** to compare each component against the style guide
- **Identifies issues** with backgrounds, text colors, borders, badges, buttons, icons, and cards
- **Generates detailed reports** with specific suggestions for each issue
- **Calculates statistics** on total files, issues by severity, and problem areas

#### Usage:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
node scripts/ai-style-analyzer.js
```

The analyzer will:
1. Check if Ollama is installed and running
2. Load the color scheme standard
3. Find all `.tsx` and `.jsx` files
4. Analyze each file using AI
5. Generate a detailed JSON report in `ai-style-reports/`
6. Display a summary in the console

#### Output:
- **JSON report**: `ai-style-reports/style-analysis-[timestamp].json`
- **Console summary**: Statistics and severity breakdown
- **Issue details**: Line numbers, current vs. suggested classes, and explanations

### 3. AI Style Fixer (`scripts/ai-style-fixer.js`)

An automated fixer that:
- **Loads analysis reports** from the analyzer
- **Applies suggested fixes** to component files
- **Creates backups** before making changes
- **Supports multiple modes**:
  - **Interactive**: Review and approve each file individually
  - **Auto-fix**: Apply all fixes automatically
  - **Review-only**: Display issues without making changes

#### Usage:
```bash
# List available reports
node scripts/ai-style-fixer.js

# Apply fixes from a specific report
node scripts/ai-style-fixer.js ai-style-reports/style-analysis-[timestamp].json
```

The fixer will:
1. Load the specified report
2. Ask which mode to use (interactive, auto-fix, or review-only)
3. Process each file with issues
4. Create backups in `ai-style-backups/` before making changes
5. Apply the suggested fixes
6. Display a summary of changes

#### Safety Features:
- **Automatic backups**: Every modified file is backed up with timestamp
- **Interactive mode**: Review each file before changes
- **Regex-based replacement**: Precise matching to avoid unintended changes
- **Dry-run option**: Review-only mode to see what would change

## Workflow

### Initial Analysis
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
node scripts/ai-style-analyzer.js
```

This will scan all components and generate a report showing:
- Which files have styling issues
- Severity of each issue (high, medium, low)
- Specific problematic class names
- Suggested replacements

### Review and Fix

After analysis, you have three options:

#### Option 1: Interactive Fixing
```bash
node scripts/ai-style-fixer.js ai-style-reports/style-analysis-[latest].json
# Choose option 1 for interactive mode
```

This lets you:
- Review each file's issues
- Decide whether to apply fixes
- Skip files you want to handle manually
- Quit at any time

#### Option 2: Auto-Fix All
```bash
node scripts/ai-style-fixer.js ai-style-reports/style-analysis-[latest].json
# Choose option 2 for auto-fix mode
```

This will:
- Apply all fixes automatically
- Create backups of all modified files
- Show a summary of changes

#### Option 3: Review Only
```bash
node scripts/ai-style-fixer.js ai-style-reports/style-analysis-[latest].json
# Choose option 3 for review-only mode
```

This will:
- Display all issues in detail
- Not modify any files
- Help you understand what needs to be changed

### Testing and Verification

After applying fixes:

1. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd app && yarn dev
   ```

2. **Test the application**:
   - Check all pages load correctly
   - Verify text is readable
   - Ensure buttons and interactive elements work
   - Check that the dark theme is consistent

3. **Run the analyzer again**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/ai-style-analyzer.js
   ```
   This verifies that issues were fixed correctly

4. **If issues occur**, restore from backups:
   ```bash
   # Backups are stored in ai-style-backups/
   cp ai-style-backups/ComponentName.tsx.[timestamp].bak src/components/ComponentName.tsx
   ```

## Example Analysis Output

```json
{
  "filePath": "components/SomeComponent.tsx",
  "hasIssues": true,
  "severity": "high",
  "issues": [
    {
      "line": 42,
      "type": "background",
      "current": "bg-white",
      "suggested": "bg-slate-800",
      "reason": "White background should be replaced with dark theme color"
    },
    {
      "line": 45,
      "type": "text",
      "current": "text-gray-900",
      "suggested": "text-slate-100",
      "reason": "Dark text on dark background has poor contrast"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Component uses light theme colors inconsistent with style guide"
}
```

const CONFIG = {
  ollamaModel: 'llama3.2',  // Change to 'mistral', 'codellama', etc.
  // ...
};
```

### Adjusting Analysis Parameters

Edit the prompt in `analyzeComponent()` function to:
- Focus on specific styling aspects
- Change severity thresholds
- Add custom rules

### Extending the Style Guide

Edit `COLOR_SCHEME_STANDARD.md` to:
- Add new component patterns
- Define additional color schemes
- Update accessibility requirements
- Document new anti-patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Run analyzer regularly**: After adding new components or features
2. **Fix high-severity issues first**: Start with the most critical problems
3. **Test incrementally**: Fix a few files, test, then continue
4. **Keep backups**: Don't delete backup files until you're sure fixes work
5. **Update the style guide**: Document any new patterns you introduce
6. **Review AI suggestions**: The AI is smart but not perfectâ€”use your judgment

## Troubleshooting

### "Ollama is not installed"
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Or run the local AI installation script
cd /home/ubuntu/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
./install-local-ai.sh
```

### "Model not found"
```bash
# Pull the model
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### "Unable to parse AI response"
- The AI response might not be valid JSON
- Check `ai-style-reports/` for the raw response
- Try a different model (e.g., `codellama`)

### "Fixes caused errors"
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp ai-style-backups/ComponentName.tsx.[timestamp].bak src/components/ComponentName.tsx

# Or restore all files
cd ai-style-backups
for file in *.bak; do
  original=$(echo $file | sed 's/\.[0-9T-]*\.bak$//')
  cp "$file" "../src/components/$original"
done
```
