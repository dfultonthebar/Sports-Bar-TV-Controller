# Fix Summary

## Issue
The root route (/) was returning 404 errors because the .next build directory was stale and didn't include the root page in the route manifest.

## Root Cause
- The app/page.tsx file existed and was correctly configured
- However, the .next/app-path-routes-manifest.json did not contain an entry for '/page'
- This caused Next.js to serve the 404 page for all root route requests

## Solution
1. Removed the stale .next build directory
2. Rebuilt the application using 'npm run build'
3. Verified the root route now exists in the manifest
4. Tested the server - all routes now return 200 OK

## Files Changed
- Deleted .next/ directory (build cache)
- No source code changes were needed

## Verification
- curl -I http://localhost:3000/ returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK
- Server is running successfully on port 3000
- All other routes (/ai-hub, /remote, etc.) also working correctly
