## 🖨️ Printing Recommendations

   - Each serves a different purpose
   - Multiple access points = faster problem resolution

   - **Emergency Contact Card:** Multiple locations (bar, office, server room)
   - **Emergency Quick Reference:** Near server, manager's office

4. **Use bright colored paper**
   - Yellow, orange, or bright green
   - Makes documents easy to spot in emergency
   - High visibility = faster access

5. **Update contact information**
   - Fill in all [FILL IN] placeholders
   - Use permanent marker after laminating
   - Update when phone numbers change
