   - Proper Tailwind usage
   - Consistent spacing
   - Responsive design patterns

3. **Code Quality**
   - Best practices
   - Accessibility
   - Performance optimizations

4. **UI/UX Issues**

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Analysis to Complete
The analysis is running in background. Check progress with:
```bash
./check-style-analysis.sh
```

### 2. Review the Report
Once complete (shows "Analysis complete!" in log):
```bash
# View the latest report
ls -lt ai-style-reports/style-analysis-*.json | head -1

# Read the markdown version
ls -lt ai-style-reports/style-analysis-*.md | head -1 | xargs cat
```

### 3. Apply Fixes (Optional)
If the AI generated fixes:
```bash
# View fix script
ls -lt ai-style-reports/fixes/apply-fixes-*.sh | head -1 | xargs cat

# Apply fixes (review first!)
ls -lt ai-style-reports/fixes/apply-fixes-*.sh | head -1 | xargs bash
```

### 4. Run Analysis Again
After applying fixes:
```bash
./scripts/run-style-analysis.sh
# Choose option 1: Analyze all components
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Analysis Stuck or Slow?
AI analysis of 89 components takes time. Each component requires:
- Reading the file
- Sending to AI model
- Processing response
- Writing report

**Estimated time**: 10-20 seconds per component = 15-30 minutes total

### Check Current Component
```bash
tail -5 ai-style-analysis-run.log
```

### Analysis Failed?
```bash
# Check for errors
grep "Error" ai-style-analysis-run.log

# Restart if needed
pkill -f "ai-style-analyzer"
node scripts/ai-style-analyzer.js > ai-style-analysis-run.log 2>&1 &
```

### Ollama Not Responding?
```bash
# Restart Ollama
pkill ollama
sleep 2
ollama serve &
sleep 3

# Verify models
ollama list
```
