## üßπ Branch Cleanup Recommendations

### Status of Feature Branches
I identified 50+ branches in the repository. To properly clean them up, we have several options:

**Option 1: Conservative Cleanup**
- Keep all branches for now
- Only delete branches that are confirmed merged and no longer needed
- User manually reviews each branch

**Option 2: Aggressive Cleanup (Recommended)**
- Delete all branches that are fully merged into main
- Delete branches older than 30 days with no activity
- Keep only active development branches
- Archive important historical branches with tags

**Option 3: Smart Cleanup**
- Analyze each branch's commit history
- Keep branches with unique commits not in main
- Delete branches that point to commits already in main
- Create tags for important milestones before deletion

### Branches That May Be Ready for Deletion
Based on naming patterns, these branches likely contain merged features:
- `channel-presets` (preset features merged)
- `complete-drizzle-migration-all` (if migration is complete)
- Various `docs/*` branches (if documentation is up-to-date)
- Older dated branches like `add-qa-training-data-20251006`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendation
Before deleting any branches, I recommend:
1. Verifying each branch's purpose with the project team
2. Checking if any open PRs depend on these branches
3. Creating git tags for important milestones
4. Backing up the repository before bulk deletion

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Merge working server code to main
2. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Push changes to GitHub
3. **PENDING:** Verify application works after pull from GitHub
4. **PENDING:** Clean up feature branches (awaiting user confirmation)

### Suggested Workflow for Branch Cleanup
```bash
# 1. Fetch all branches
git fetch --all --prune

# 2. List merged branches
git branch -r --merged origin/main

# 3. Delete specific branches (example)
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# 4. Clean up local references
git remote prune origin
```

### Testing Recommendations
1. Pull latest main on the server
2. Rebuild the application
3. Test all preset functionality
4. Verify bartender remote features
5. Test settings page functionality
