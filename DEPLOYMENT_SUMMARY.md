## ⚠️ PENDING TASK: Remote Server Deployment

### Issue Encountered
Cannot connect to remote server at 24.123.187.42:
- SSH port 22: Connection timeout
- RDP port 3389: Connection timeout

**Possible Causes:**
1. Server is behind a firewall blocking external connections
2. Server requires VPN access
3. Server may be offline
4. Network configuration restricts access

### Required Manual Steps

You will need to manually deploy to the remote server. Here's the complete process:

#### Step 1: Connect to Remote Server
Use one of these methods:
- **RDP:** Connect to 24.123.187.42:3389
- **SSH:** ssh Administrator@24.123.187.42
- **Credentials:** Administrator / 6809233DjD$$$

#### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
# Windows
cd C:\path\to\Sports-Bar-TV-Controller

# Linux
cd /path/to/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
```

#### Step 3: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Step 4: Update Dependencies
```bash
# Remove old Prisma packages
npm uninstall prisma @prisma/client

# Install all dependencies (includes Drizzle)
npm install
```

#### Step 5: Setup Database
```bash
# Push schema to database
npm run db:push
```

#### Step 6: Rebuild and Restart
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Restart the application
# If using PM2:
pm2 restart tv-controller

# If using npm directly:
npm start

# If in development:
npm run dev
```

### Quick Deployment Script (Windows PowerShell)

Save this as `deploy.ps1` on the remote server and run it:

```powershell
Write-Host "🚀 Deploying Drizzle ORM Migration..." -ForegroundColor Green

Set-Location "C:\path\to\Sports-Bar-TV-Controller"

Write-Host "📥 Pulling latest changes..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
git pull origin main

Write-Host "🗑️ Removing Prisma..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
npm uninstall prisma @prisma/client

Write-Host "📦 Installing dependencies..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
npm install

Write-Host "🗄️ Setting up database..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
npm run db:push

Write-Host "🔨 Building application..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
npm run build

Write-Host "♻️ Restarting application..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
pm2 restart tv-controller

Write-Host "✅ Deployment complete!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### Quick Deployment Script (Linux/Mac Bash)

Save this as `deploy.sh` on the remote server and run it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🚀 Deploying Drizzle ORM Migration..."
cd /path/to/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller

echo "📥 Pulling latest changes..."
git pull origin main

echo "🗑️ Removing Prisma..."
npm uninstall prisma @prisma/client

echo "📦 Installing dependencies..."
npm install

echo "🗄️ Setting up database..."
npm run db:push

echo "🔨 Building application..."
npm run build

echo "♻️ Restarting application..."
pm2 restart tv-controller || npm start

echo "✅ Deployment complete!"
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Database connection works (check logs)
- [ ] Can read/write to database
- [ ] Atlas Atmosphere DSP connection works
- [ ] All TV controller features operational
- [ ] No Prisma-related errors in logs

## 📊 What Changed in the Migration

### Database Schema
The schema remains functionally identical but is now defined using Drizzle's syntax:
- All tables preserved
- All relationships maintained
- All constraints intact

### Code Changes
- Database queries now use Drizzle syntax
- Type safety improved with Drizzle's TypeScript integration
- Better performance with Drizzle's query builder

### Benefits
- ✅ Lighter weight (no Prisma Client generation)
- ✅ Better TypeScript integration
- ✅ More control over queries
- ✅ Faster development iteration

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Database Connection Fails
1. Check `.env` file has correct DATABASE_URL
2. Verify PostgreSQL/SQLite is running
3. Run `npm run db:push` again

### If Application Won't Start
1. Check logs: `pm2 logs tv-controller`
2. Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Try rebuilding: `npm run build`

### If Features Don't Work
1. Check for migration errors in logs
2. Verify database schema: `npm run db:studio`
3. Test database queries manually
