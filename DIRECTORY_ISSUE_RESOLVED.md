# Directory Mismatch Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
The user was experiencing a TypeError with an old file hash (`page-f2772c14eae98f26.js`) even after rebuilding the code. The root cause was a combination of:

1. **PM2 daemon was not running** - The process had died
2. **Browser cache** - Old JavaScript files were cached in the browser

## Investigation Results

### Directory Structure
- ❌ `~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller` - **Does NOT exist**
- ✅ `~/github_repos/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller` - **This is the ONLY project directory**

### PM2 Configuration
- **Working Directory**: `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller`
- **Script Path**: `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller/node_modules/next/dist/bin/next`
- **Status**: Now running successfully on port 3000

### Build Status
- ✅ Fresh build completed successfully
- ✅ Old hash (`page-f2772c14eae98f26.js`) completely removed from server
- ✅ New hash (`page-4557a3bbb171eeb1.js`) is being served
- ✅ Application is running on http://localhost:3000

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Identified PM2 was not running** - Process 2601 was dead
2. **Resurrected PM2** using the dump file configuration
3. **Rebuilt the application** with `npm run build`
4. **Verified new build** - All new hashes generated
5. **Restarted PM2** - Application now serving fresh code

## Current Status

### Server Side ✅
- PM2 is running (PID: 3083)
- Application is online and healthy
- New build artifacts are being served
- No old hash files present on server

### Client Side ⚠️
- **Browser cache needs to be cleared** to see the fix
- The old JavaScript file is cached in the user's browser

## Instructions for User

### To Fix the Browser Cache Issue:

**Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)**
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Option 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Option 3: Incognito/Private Window**
- Open the application in a new incognito/private window
- This bypasses all cache

### Verification
After clearing cache, the application should load without the TypeError. The new build includes all the fixes from PR #99.

## Important Notes for Future

### Single Project Directory
- **Always work in**: `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller`
- This is the ONLY directory - there is no `~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller`
- PM2 is configured to run from this directory

### PM2 Management
To manage the application:
```bash
# Set PATH for PM2
export PATH="/usr/local/nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin:/home/ubuntu/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"

# Find PM2
PM2_PATH=$(find /home/ubuntu/.npm-global -name pm2 -type f 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)

# Common commands
$PM2_PATH ls                              # List processes
$PM2_PATH restart sports-bar-tv-controller # Restart app
$PM2_PATH logs sports-bar-tv-controller    # View logs
$PM2_PATH stop sports-bar-tv-controller    # Stop app
$PM2_PATH start sports-bar-tv-controller   # Start app
```

### Building the Application
```bash
cd ~/github_repos/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
npm run build
```

### Current Branch
- Branch: `fix-ai-teach-null-entries`
- Latest commit: `913b813 Add diagnostic report: TypeError fix required fresh build`
- Remote: GitHub repository

## Summary

✅ **Server Issue**: RESOLVED - PM2 restarted, fresh build deployed  
⚠️ **Client Issue**: Browser cache needs clearing (user action required)  
✅ **Directory Confusion**: RESOLVED - Only one directory exists  
✅ **Build Status**: All new hashes, no old files present  

The application is now running correctly on the server. The user just needs to clear their browser cache to see the updated code.
