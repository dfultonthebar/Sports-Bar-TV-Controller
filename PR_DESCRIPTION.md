# Fix AI Q&A Generation and Integrate Chatbot Tools

## Overview

This PR fixes two critical issues with the AI features:

1. **Q&A Training System generating 0 Q&A pairs** despite processing 126 files
2. **AI Chatbot lacking file system access and code execution capabilities**

## Issue 1: Q&A Training Generation Producing 0 Results

### Root Cause
The Q&A generation system was processing files correctly but failing to generate any Q&A pairs due to:
- Silent Ollama API failures
- Weak JSON parsing that couldn't handle various response formats
- No response validation before parsing
- Missing error reporting to UI
- No timeout handling

### Fixes
- ✅ Added 60-second timeout protection per file
- ✅ Improved JSON parsing with 3 strategies (flexible regex, code blocks, fallback)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- ✅ Better prompt engineering for consistent JSON output
- ✅ Comprehensive job tracking with error collection
- ✅ Validates Ollama responses before parsing
- ✅ Filters Q&As by minimum content length

### Changes to `src/lib/services/qa-generator.ts`
- Enhanced Ollama API calls with timeout and validation (60s timeout)
- Improved JSON parsing with multiple strategies and retry logic
- Better Q&A validation (10+ char questions, 20+ char answers)
- Comprehensive error tracking and reporting to UI
- Improved prompt with explicit JSON-only instructions

## Issue 2: Chatbot Lacking File System Access

### Root Cause
The AI chatbot was using the basic `/api/chat` endpoint which only called Ollama directly without any tool integration. The AI tools framework existed but wasn't connected to the main chat interface.

### Fixes
- ✅ Integrated AI tools framework into main chat endpoint
- ✅ Added tool execution loop (max 5 iterations)
- ✅ Implemented tool parsing from AI responses
- ✅ Added file system tools (read, write, list, search, info)
- ✅ Added code execution tools (Python, JS, shell, npm, analyze)
- ✅ Enhanced system prompt with tool descriptions
- ✅ Tool results formatted and fed back to AI

### Changes to `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Integrated AI tools framework with imports and types
- Added tool discovery and prompting in system message
- Implemented tool execution loop with max 5 iterations
- Added helper functions: buildToolsPrompt, parseToolCalls, executeTools, formatToolResults
- Enhanced response with tool metadata (toolCalls, toolResults, iterations)

## Available AI Tools

### File System Tools
- **read_file**: Read contents of a file
- **write_file**: Write content to a file
- **list_directory**: List files in a directory
- **search_files**: Search for files by pattern
- **get_file_info**: Get file metadata

### Code Execution Tools
- **execute_python**: Execute Python code
- **execute_javascript**: Execute JavaScript code
- **execute_shell**: Execute shell commands
- **run_npm_command**: Run npm commands
- **analyze_code**: Analyze code structure

## Testing

### Q&A Generation
1. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
2. Navigate to AI Hub → Q&A Training
3. Click "Generate from Repository"
4. Watch progress bar and status messages
5. Verify Q&As are created in the list

### Chatbot Tools
1. Ask: "Can you read the package.json file?"
2. Ask: "What files are in the src/lib/ai-tools directory?"
3. Ask: "Find all TypeScript files related to AI tools"
4. Verify AI uses appropriate tools and returns results

## Error Handling

### Q&A Generation
- Timeout protection (60 seconds per file)
- Connection error detection
- Invalid response structure detection
- JSON parsing with multiple strategies
- Detailed error messages in job status
- Progress tracking with file counts

### Chatbot Tools
- Tool execution error handling
- Invalid tool call detection
- Parameter validation
- Timeout protection (30 seconds per tool)
- Graceful degradation if tools fail

## Security

### File System Access
- Tools sandboxed to project directory
- Path validation prevents directory traversal
- Read-only operations by default

### Code Execution
- Execution timeout limits
- Memory limits enforced
- Sandboxed environment

## Files Changed
- `src/lib/services/qa-generator.ts` (180 lines changed)
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (160 lines added)
- `AI_FEATURES_FIX_SUMMARY.md` (comprehensive documentation)

## Related Issues
Fixes the issues reported where:
- Q&A Training shows "Generated: 0 Q&As" despite processing 126 files
- Chatbot can't access file system or execute code despite PR #111 adding the framework

Both issues are now fully resolved with extensive error handling and logging.
