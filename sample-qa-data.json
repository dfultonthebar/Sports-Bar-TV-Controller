    "question": "How does the knowledge base system work?",
    "answer": "The knowledge base system indexes documentation files (PDFs and Markdown) from the docs/ folder and code files from the repository. It creates searchable chunks of content that the AI assistant uses to answer questions. The system automatically rebuilds the knowledge base when documentation is updated. You can manually rebuild it using the 'npm run build-knowledge-base' command.",

    "question": "What environment variables need to be configured?",
    "answer": "Key environment variables include: DATABASE_URL (path to SQLite database), OLLAMA_BASE_URL (URL for local AI model, default http://localhost:11434), API keys for external services (ESPN, TheSportsDB, etc.), and network configuration for matrix switchers and audio processors. Copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in your specific values.",

    "question": "Can I use this system with different matrix switcher brands?",
    "answer": "The system is designed for AtlasIED and Wolfpack matrix switchers, which use specific TCP/IP protocols. While the architecture could be adapted for other brands, it would require implementing new communication protocols in the matrix API libraries. The current implementation is optimized for AtlasIED's command structure and response format.",

    "question": "How do I troubleshoot 'connection refused' errors?",
    "answer": "Connection refused errors typically indicate: 1) The target device (matrix, audio processor) is powered off or not on the network, 2) Incorrect IP address or port configuration, 3) Firewall blocking the connection, 4) Network connectivity issues. Check device power and network status, verify IP addresses in the configuration, test connectivity with ping, and check firewall rules. The AI assistant can analyze logs to identify specific connection issues.",

    "question": "What is the purpose of the AI Hub?",
    "answer": "The AI Hub is the central interface for AI-powered features including: chat with the AI assistant for help and troubleshooting, log analysis for identifying system issues, document upload for expanding the knowledge base, system diagnostics, and now Q&A training for teaching the AI about your specific setup. It provides a unified interface for all AI capabilities.",

  {
    "question": "How do I add custom documentation to the knowledge base?",
    "answer": "To add custom documentation: 1) Place PDF or Markdown files in the docs/ folder, 2) Run 'npm run build-knowledge-base' to reindex, or 3) Use the AI Hub's document upload feature to upload files directly through the web interface. The system will automatically extract text content and make it searchable for the AI assistant.",
