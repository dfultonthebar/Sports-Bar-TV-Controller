================================================================================
                        MINOR OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

1. Timezone Inconsistency (Non-critical)
   - Cable Box & DirecTV: Show EST timezone
   - Fire TV: Shows CST timezone
   - Recommendation: Consider unifying timezone display for consistency

2. Duplicate Channel Display (Non-critical)
   - DirecTV Channel 219 displays as both "Fox Sports 1" and "FS1"
   - Both point to same network content
   - Recommendation: Verify if duplication is intentional or consolidate

3. Different UI Architecture (By Design)
   - Fire TV uses completely different interface (app-based vs grid)
   - This is intentional and appropriate for streaming devices
   - No change recommended


================================================================================
                      USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
