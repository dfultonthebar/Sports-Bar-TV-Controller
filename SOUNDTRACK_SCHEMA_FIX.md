# Soundtrack API Schema Fix - October 1, 2025

## Problem Identified

The Soundtrack Your Brand integration was showing this error:
```
Field 'soundZones' does not exist on type 'Viewer'
```

This indicates the GraphQL query structure doesn't match your Soundtrack account's API schema.

## Solution Implemented

I've updated the Soundtrack API integration with **intelligent query pattern detection**:

### Changes Made

1. **Multi-Pattern Fallback System**
   - Tries multiple GraphQL query structures automatically
   - Falls back to REST API if GraphQL fails
   - No manual configuration needed

2. **Enhanced Diagnostics**
   - GraphQL introspection to discover available queries
   - Tests multiple query patterns and reports which works
   - Detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error messages
   - Helpful recommendations
   - Automatic fallback logic

## üîÑ Update Instructions

### To get the fix:

```bash
cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
./update_from_github.sh
```

The update script will:
- ‚úÖ Pull latest code from GitHub
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies
- ‚úÖ Rebuild the application
- ‚úÖ Restart the server
- ‚úÖ Preserve all your configuration data

## üß™ Testing the Fix

After updating:

1. **Open the Soundtrack page:**
   ```
   http://192.168.1.25:3000/soundtrack
   ```

2. **Enter your API token**
   - Get it from: https://business.soundtrackyourbrand.com/
   - Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí API Access
   - Copy the entire token (already base64-encoded)

3. **Click "Test API Connection"**
   
   The test will now:
   - Try different query patterns
   - Show which pattern works
   - Display available API queries
   - Provide specific recommendations

4. **Review the results:**
   - ‚úÖ **Success:** Shows "Successfully connected" + which pattern worked
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Shows what failed and suggests fixes
   - ‚ùå **Error:** Detailed message with next steps

## üìã What The Test Does

### Pattern 1: Direct Query (Try First)
```graphql
{
  soundZones { id name }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Viewer Query (Fallback)
```graphql
{
  viewer { soundZones { id name } }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Me Query (Alternative)
```graphql
{
  me { id }
}
```

### Pattern 4: REST API (Last Resort)
```
GET /v2/accounts
```

The system automatically tries all patterns and uses the one that works.

## üéØ Expected Results

### If Token is Valid and Has Permissions:

You'll see one of these success messages:

**GraphQL Success:**
```
‚úÖ Successfully connected to Soundtrack Your Brand API
Working query: soundZones direct
Available queries: [list of available API queries]
```

**REST Success:**
```
‚úÖ Successfully connected to Soundtrack Your Brand API (REST)
Note: GraphQL queries failed, but REST API is working
```

### If There's an Issue:

You'll see specific error messages like:

```
‚ùå Authentication failed
‚Üí Check your API token is correct and not expired
```

```
‚ùå Field 'X' does not exist on type 'Y'
‚Üí Your account may have limited API access
‚Üí Contact Soundtrack support to verify API permissions
```

```
‚ùå 404 Not Found
‚Üí Check your account has API access enabled
‚Üí Verify endpoint: https://api.soundtrackyourbrand.com/v2
```

   - Music controls will appear
   - Test play/pause/volume

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Having Issues

### Check These Common Causes:

1. **Token Issues**
   - Token expired (generate new one)
   - Token copied incorrectly (check for spaces)
   - Token doesn't have required permissions

2. **Account Issues**
   - No sound zones configured in Soundtrack
   - API access not enabled for your account
   - Account subscription level doesn't include API

3. **Network Issues**
   - Firewall blocking Soundtrack API
   - DNS resolution problems
   - Internet connection issues

### Get Help

1. **Check application logs:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
   pm2 logs sports-bar | grep -i soundtrack
   ```

2. **Manual API test:**
   ```bash
   # See SOUNDTRACK_API_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for curl commands
   ```
