# 🚀 Quick Start: Pull Changes and Fix Deployment

This guide will help you pull the latest deployment fixes and get your application running.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Node.js and npm installed
- Access to your Sports-Bar-TV-Controller repository

## 🔄 Step 1: Pull Latest Changes

Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then pull the latest changes:

```bash
cd /path/to/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller
git pull origin main
```

## 🛠️ Step 2: Run the Fix Script

We've created an automated fix script that will:
- Install all dependencies
- Apply database fixes
- Fix port scoping issues
- Update API routes
- Build the application

Run the script:

```bash
chmod +x fix_deployment.sh
./fix_deployment.sh
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Install npm dependencies
2. ✅ Apply all necessary fixes
3. ✅ Build the production version
4. ✅ Display a summary of changes

## ✅ Step 3: Verify the Application

After the script completes successfully, start your application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The deployment fixes included:

### 1. **Database Type Bindings** ✅
   - Fixed Date to ISO string conversions
   - Updated all database queries to use proper Drizzle ORM syntax
   - Corrected timestamp handling across all models

### 2. **Port Variable Scoping** ✅
   - Fixed global port variable conflicts
   - Properly scoped port variables in device services
   - Ensured each service manages its own port state

### 3. **API Route Updates** ✅
   - Updated channel-presets routes
   - Fixed QA training statistics
   - Corrected device configuration endpoints
   - Updated audio control endpoints

### 4. **Syntax Fixes** ✅
   - Fixed comment syntax in multiple files
   - Corrected TypeScript type annotations
   - Updated import statements

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
If the build fails, check the error message and ensure:
- All dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Your Node.js version is compatible (v18 or higher recommended)
- The database file exists at `./prisma/data/sports_bar.db`

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port already in use" errors:
1. Stop any running instances of the app
2. Check for processes using ports 3000-3010
3. Restart the application

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors:
1. Ensure the database file exists: `./prisma/data/sports_bar.db`
2. Check database permissions
3. Run database migrations if needed: `npm run db:migrate`
