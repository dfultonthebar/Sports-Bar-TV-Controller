### Configure Local AI Services - Multiple Connection Errors

- **ID**: `cmgrg16lb000626tqpqcgkrfy`
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Configuration
- **Description**: Configuration tab shows 5 local AI services with connection errors. While Ollama is working correctly and cloud services (OpenAI, Anthropic, X.AI) are ready, several local AI options are not accessible.

Services with Errors:
1. Custom Local AI (http://localhost:8000/v1/models) - Error
2. LocalAI (http://localhost:8080/v1/models) - Error
3. LM Studio (http://localhost:1234/v1/models) - Error
4. Text Generation WebUI (http://localhost:5000/v1/models) - Error
5. Tabby (http://localhost:8080/v1/models) - Error

Working Services:
- Ollama (http://localhost:11434/api/tags, Model: phi3:mini) - Active (4ms)
- OpenAI - Ready (API key configured)
- Anthropic Claude - Ready (API key configured)
- X.AI Grok - Ready (API key configured)

Steps to Fix:
1. Verify each service is installed and running
2. Update service URLs in configuration
3. Add service health check with retry logic
4. Document installation instructions for each service
5. Consider making local services optional
6. Add configuration UI to enable/disable services

Affected: Configuration Tab → AI Provider Status
User Impact: LOW - Limited local AI options, but reliance on cloud services is acceptable
Priority: MEDIUM - Fix when possible
Tested: October 15, 2025
- **Tags**: ai-hub, configuration, local-ai

### Optimize AI Assistant Chat Response Performance

- **ID**: `cmgrg16gb000526tq6vkvvwel`
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Performance
- **Description**: AI Assistant chat responses take 15+ seconds to generate, resulting in poor user experience. While the feature is functional, the response time is unacceptably slow.

Observed Behavior:
- Question: "What is this application about?"
- Response Time: 15+ seconds
- Result: Successful response but with significant delay

Steps to Optimize:
1. Profile the AI model response time
2. Implement streaming responses instead of waiting for complete response
3. Add response caching for common questions
4. Consider using faster AI model for simple queries
5. Optimize context window size
6. Add better loading indicators and estimated wait time
7. Consider implementing response timeouts

Affected: AI Assistant Tab → Chat Interface
User Impact: MEDIUM - Feature works but user experience is degraded
Priority: HIGH - Should be fixed soon
Tested: October 15, 2025
- **Tags**: ai-hub, performance, optimization, high-priority

### CRITICAL: Fix Codebase Indexing 404 Error

- **ID**: `cmgrg16ba000426tqx9cpysv3`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Bug Fix
- **Description**: Sync Codebase feature in AI Assistant tab returns 404 (Not Found) error. API endpoint /api/ai-assistant/index-codebase does not exist or is not properly configured.

Error: GET http://24.123.87.42:3000/api/ai-assistant/index-codebase 404 (Internal Server Error)

Steps to Fix:
1. Verify API route exists in Next.js API routes directory
2. Check route file naming (should be route.ts or index.ts in app router)
3. Ensure proper HTTP method handling (GET/POST)
4. Add endpoint to API route mapping if missing
5. Implement codebase indexing logic if missing
6. Test with actual codebase directory
7. Verify route is not blocked by middleware

Affected: AI Assistant Tab → Sync Codebase button
User Impact: HIGH - Core feature completely non-functional
Tested: October 15, 2025
- **Tags**: ai-hub, api, critical, codebase-indexing
- **Created**: 10/14/2025, 10:40:42 PM

### CRITICAL: Fix Q&A Entry Creation Database Error

- **ID**: `cmgrg164x000326tq395lp65b`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Bug Fix
- **Description**: Q&A Training feature fails when attempting to add Q&A entries. API route api/qa-entries.ts returns 500 Internal Server Error with "Database error: Failed to create Q&A entry".

Test Case that Failed:
- Category: General
- Question: "What is the server IP address for this application?"
- Answer: "The server IP address is 24.123.87.42 and the application runs on port 3000."
- Result: Entry was not created, error displayed

Steps to Fix:
1. Check database schema for qa_entries table
2. Verify Prisma schema includes Q&A entry model
3. Check for missing migrations
4. Review API route handler for database connection errors
5. Test database write permissions
6. Add proper error logging for troubleshooting

Affected: Teach AI Tab → Q&A Training
User Impact: HIGH - Users cannot add Q&A training pairs to teach the AI
Tested: October 15, 2025
- **Tags**: ai-hub, database, critical, qa-training

### DirecTV Integration: SHEF API Fix Successfully Deployed

- **ID**: `cmgsdanob000026271c52teh9`
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Category**: Bug Fix
- **Description**: ## Summary

Successfully debugged and fixed DirecTV receiver communication issues. The root cause was a fundamental misunderstanding of the SHEF API capabilities.

## Root Cause

- Code was attempting to retrieve subscription data from `/info/getOptions` endpoint
- This endpoint returns API command list, NOT subscription/package data
- DirecTV SHEF API does NOT expose subscription information
- This is a protocol limitation, not a device or network issue

## Fix Applied

✅ Fixed subscription polling logic in `src/lib/real-device-subscriptions.ts`
✅ Removed incorrect logic parsing API commands as subscriptions
✅ Now retrieves real device information: receiver ID, access card, current channel, program
✅ Deployed to production server (commit eb743ad)
✅ Tested successfully via web interface
✅ Updated SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md with complete SHEF API documentation

## Test Results

- DirecTV receiver (H24/100 at 192.168.5.121) is FULLY OPERATIONAL
- All SHEF endpoints tested and working (9 endpoints)
- Device connectivity: 100% success
- Real-time channel information: Working
- Device status display: Working

## Documentation Updates

- Added comprehensive SHEF protocol documentation
- Documented all available API endpoints with examples
- Explained API capabilities and limitations
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Created detailed debug report: /home/ubuntu/directv_debug_report.md

## Deliverables

✅ Working DirecTV receiver communication
✅ Updated SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md with SHEF protocol details
✅ Comprehensive debug report
✅ Deployed and tested fix

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

### CRITICAL: Fix DirecTV Matrix Input Channel Field

- **ID**: `cmgs8kq9q0000265ujrrl77ky`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Category**: Bug Fix
- **Description**: The Matrix Input Channel field in the Add DirecTV Receiver form does not accept or store input values. Form validation fails with error: "Please select which matrix input this DirecTV box is connected to" even when value is entered. This blocks all DirecTV receiver additions. Investigation needed in device-config form component to fix React state management or change field to dropdown.
