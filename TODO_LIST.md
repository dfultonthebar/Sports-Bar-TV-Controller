## 📋 Planned

### Optimize AI Assistant Chat Response Performance

- **ID**: `cmgrg16gb000526tq6vkvvwel`
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Performance
- **Description**: AI Assistant chat responses take 15+ seconds to generate, resulting in poor user experience. While the feature is functional, the response time is unacceptably slow.

Observed Behavior:
- Question: "What is this application about?"
- Response Time: 15+ seconds
- Result: Successful response but with significant delay

Steps to Optimize:
1. Profile the AI model response time
2. Implement streaming responses instead of waiting for complete response
3. Add response caching for common questions
4. Consider using faster AI model for simple queries
5. Optimize context window size
6. Add better loading indicators and estimated wait time
7. Consider implementing response timeouts

Affected: AI Assistant Tab → Chat Interface
User Impact: MEDIUM - Feature works but user experience is degraded
Priority: HIGH - Should be fixed soon
Tested: October 15, 2025

### CRITICAL: Fix Codebase Indexing 404 Error

- **ID**: `cmgrg16ba000426tqx9cpysv3`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Bug Fix
- **Description**: Sync Codebase feature in AI Assistant tab returns 404 (Not Found) error. API endpoint /api/ai-assistant/index-codebase does not exist or is not properly configured.

Error: GET http://24.123.87.42:3000/api/ai-assistant/index-codebase 404 (Internal Server Error)

Steps to Fix:
1. Verify API route exists in Next.js API routes directory
2. Check route file naming (should be route.ts or index.ts in app router)
3. Ensure proper HTTP method handling (GET/POST)
4. Add endpoint to API route mapping if missing
5. Implement codebase indexing logic if missing
6. Test with actual codebase directory
7. Verify route is not blocked by middleware

Affected: AI Assistant Tab → Sync Codebase button
User Impact: HIGH - Core feature completely non-functional
Tested: October 15, 2025
- **Tags**: ai-hub, api, critical, codebase-indexing
- **Created**: 10/14/2025, 10:40:42 PM

### CRITICAL: Fix Q&A Entry Creation Database Error

- **ID**: `cmgrg164x000326tq395lp65b`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Category**: Bug Fix
- **Description**: Q&A Training feature fails when attempting to add Q&A entries. API route api/qa-entries.ts returns 500 Internal Server Error with "Database error: Failed to create Q&A entry".

Test Case that Failed:
- Category: General
- Question: "What is the server IP address for this application?"
- Answer: "The server IP address is 24.123.87.42 and the application runs on port 3000."
- Result: Entry was not created, error displayed

Steps to Fix:
1. Check database schema for qa_entries table
2. Verify Prisma schema includes Q&A entry model
3. Check for missing migrations
4. Review API route handler for database connection errors
5. Test database write permissions
6. Add proper error logging for troubleshooting

Affected: Teach AI Tab → Q&A Training
User Impact: HIGH - Users cannot add Q&A training pairs to teach the AI
