## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Repository Setup
- Cloned repository to `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller`
- Checked out feature branch: `feature/update-tv-layout-to-match-drawing`
- Set up local development environment

### ✅ 2. Workflow Guidelines
- Read and understood `ssh.md` file containing development workflow instructions
- Noted SSH connection details for remote server deployment:
  - Host: 24.123.87.42
  - Port: 224
  - Working SSH command documented

### ✅ 3. Code Review
- Reviewed current `TVLayoutView.tsx` implementation
- Analyzed existing TV positioning and layout structure
- Identified areas for enhancement

### ✅ 4. Reference Drawing Analysis
- Reviewed `tests/layout_import/Graystone Layout.png`
- Identified key physical elements:
  - Room walls (black lines)
  - Bar structure in center
  - Partial wall above bar with back-to-back TVs
  - Directional labels (North, South, East, West)

### ✅ 5. Component Updates

#### Physical Structure Visualization
**Room Walls**
- Added white border (4px) around entire layout representing physical room walls
- Implemented as absolute-positioned overlay with z-index layering

**Bar Structure**
- Added visual representation of actual bar area in center
- Positioned at 33% left, 30% top, 28% width, 35% height
- Green-tinted background with white border

**Partial Wall Above Bar**
- Added amber-bordered partial wall showing where TVs 5-10 are mounted
- Positioned at 33% left, 18% top, 28% width, 8% height
- Label: "PARTIAL WALL (TVs 5-10 Back-to-Back)"
- Distinct amber color scheme (#fbbf24) for clear identification

**Directional Indicators**
- Added North, South, East, West labels at corners
- White badges with slate background
- Positioned using absolute positioning with proper z-index

#### TV Positioning
**Back-to-Back Configuration on Partial Wall**
- **TVs 5-7**: Face dining room (East side of partial wall)
  - TV 05: gridColumn '7 / 8', gridRow '3 / 4'
  - TV 06: gridColumn '6 / 7', gridRow '3 / 4'
  - TV 07: gridColumn '5 / 6', gridRow '3 / 4'
  - Orientation: `'facing-dining'`

- **TVs 8-10**: Face bar area (West side of partial wall)
  - TV 08: gridColumn '5 / 6', gridRow '3 / 4'
  - TV 09: gridColumn '6 / 7', gridRow '3 / 4'
  - TV 10: gridColumn '7 / 8', gridRow '3 / 4'
  - Orientation: `'facing-bar'`

**Visual Indicators for Back-to-Back TVs**
- Added amber border (2px) around TVs on partial wall
- Added orientation labels below each TV:
  - "→ Dining" for TVs 5-7
  - "← Bar" for TVs 8-10
- Added hover tooltips showing mounting information

#### Technical Implementation
**Interface Extensions**
```typescript
interface ExtendedTVDefinition extends TVDefinition {
  orientation?: 'facing-dining' | 'facing-bar' | 'normal'
}
```

**Enhanced Legend**
- Added "Walls/Structure" indicator (white bordered areas)
- Added "Partial Wall (TVs 5-10)" indicator (amber bordered area)
- Maintained existing color-coded legend for all 8 zones

**Header Updates**
- Updated description: "Physical floor plan with 25 TVs across 8 zones - TVs 5-10 mounted back-to-back on partial wall above bar"
- Added detail line: "TVs 5-7 face dining room | TVs 8-10 face bar area | Click any TV to change its source"

**Git Operations**
```bash
git add src/components/TVLayoutView.tsx
git commit -m "Update TV Layout to accurately represent physical space"

- ✅ TV positions match Graystone Layout drawing
- ✅ Physical structures accurately represented
- ✅ Back-to-back TV configuration properly visualized
- ✅ Changes deployed to remote server
- ⏳ Visual verification needed on running application

## Next Steps

1. **Review the PR**: https://github.com/dfultonthebar/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller/pull/262
2. **Visual Testing**: View the updated layout on the running application
3. **User Feedback**: Confirm the layout matches the physical space accurately
4. **Merge**: Once approved, merge PR #262 to main branch

## Reference Materials

- **Drawing**: `tests/layout_import/Graystone Layout.png`
- **Workflow**: `ssh.md`
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/update-tv-layout-to-match-drawing`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/dfultonthebar/Sports-Bar-TV-Controller

## Technical Notes

### Z-Index Layering
- z-10: Room walls and bar structure
- z-20: Partial wall and TV grid
- z-30: Directional indicators

### Color Scheme
- **Walls/Bar**: White borders (#ffffff)
- **Partial Wall**: Amber border (#d97706) with amber-tinted background
- **Directional Labels**: White text on slate-800 background

### Responsive Considerations
- Grid layout: 12 columns x 11 rows
- Minimum height: 700px
- Absolute positioning uses percentages for better responsiveness

## Success Metrics

✅ **Accuracy**: Layout matches physical drawing  
✅ **Clarity**: Back-to-back TV configuration clearly visible  
✅ **Usability**: Directional indicators help orientation  
✅ **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code  
✅ **Deployment**: Successfully pushed to remote server
